	There are a lot of ways to give any detail on runtime:
	- sum(runtimes); this includes time we waste and time you waste
	- sum(runtimes) (%overhead)
	- sum(runtimes) (overhead)
	- during + sum(before, after, setup, teardown (collectively "overhead"))
	- ...

	So perhaps it's better to think in terms of what this information would give me and the scenarios under which I want it. I want to know how long my tests take to run in total, and I want to know where there are slow tests. And when there are slow test trees, I want a sense of how much of the time spent there I am responsible for (i.e., what portion I can actually save myself, and what portion is hidden in the framework.)

	What is the desired hook failure mode? it seems like our goals should be:
	1.) that test doesn't execute (this actually isn't practical unless we actually raise an error, yeah?)
	2.) the outer test either continues, or halts; ideally anything that doesn't DEPEND on the failing test can go ahead and anything that does shouldn't run. But we don't have any real clear way of specifying when something does/n't depend. It makes little sense to test a feature that relies on another feature test that has already failed.

	python's unittest module handles this concept in the setup/teardown funcs; principle of least-surprise may dictate I take a similar tack:
	setUp()Â¶
		Method called to prepare the test fixture. This is called immediately before calling the test method; other than AssertionError or SkipTest, any exception raised by this method will be considered an error rather than a test failure. The default implementation does nothing.

	tearDown()
		Method called immediately after the test method has been called and the result recorded. This is called even if the test method raised an exception, so the implementation in subclasses may need to be particularly careful about checking internal state. Any exception, other than AssertionError or SkipTest, raised by this method will be considered an error rather than a test failure. This method will only be called if the setUp() succeeds, regardless of the outcome of the test method. The default implementation does nothing.
